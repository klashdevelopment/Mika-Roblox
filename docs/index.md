# Mika Roblox
Mika supports [Roblox](https://github.com/klashdevelopment/Mika-Roblox), [Muck](https://github.com/klashdevelopment/Mika), [Unity](https://github.com/klashdevelopment/Mika-Others), and [multipurpose games](#).
With documentation for [our roblox scripts](https://pages.klash.dev/Mika-Roblox) and [our roblox libraries](https://pages.klash.dev/Mika-Roblox/libs).

# NO SCRIPTS ARE GUARENTEED TO WORK. MIKA ROBLOX IS UNMAINTAINED WITH THE UNRELIABILITY OF EXECUTORS.

## Loading
All of Mika's scripts are in a bundle, MikaHub.

## I need an executor/scripting software/injector!
Alrighty! No problem. I personally use Comet (https://cometrbx.xyz)
You can choose from some below (**Click "LinkVertize" or "LV", NOT "LV Installer" or "LinkVertize Intaller"**)

If you need to rollback roblox to use one, follow these instructions [in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kLGEQHzjZs) Install the msix, and then follow the fiddler steps. Roblox recently patched msix and this spoof is a workaround.

| Name | Download | Features | Reason to use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Aimmy AI](https://aimmy.dev) | aimmy.dev | Made by Comet devs, aimbot/uni hack | Useful for ESP, Tracers, Aimbot, etc. in multi-game. |
| [Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.sh/) | [MacOs/Android Download](https://hydrogen.sh/download) | Mac OS & Android support | Free! |
