# Mika Roblox
Mika supports [Roblox](https://github.com/klashdevelopment/Mika-Roblox), [Muck](https://github.com/klashdevelopment/Mika), [Unity](https://github.com/klashdevelopment/Mika-Others), and [multipurpose games](#).
With documentation for [our roblox scripts](https://pages.klash.dev/Mika-Roblox) and [our roblox libraries](https://pages.klash.dev/Mika-Roblox/libs).

# NO SCRIPTS ARE GUARENTEED TO WORK. MIKA ROBLOX IS UNMAINTAINED WITH THE UNRELIABILITY OF EXECUTORS.

## I need an executor/scripting software/exploit!

**This information could be out of data. I will try to keep it updated, but you may refer to [robloxhackers](https://robloxhackers.lol/exploits) for updated info**



Personally, **I use solara and celery** to develop Mika.

Why do I use two? Solara has better auto complete and Level 3 UNC for more user support in the future, but Celery is L8 with high UNC.
