Mika is an advanced utility client made for [Roblox](https://github.com/klashdevelopment/Mika-Roblox) and [Muck](https://github.com/klashdevelopment/Mika)

## I need an executor/scripting software/injector!

### DOORS - Choosing & Using
<details>
<summary>Use a saved copy to prevent dead-links</summary>

Simply head over to the [Saved Copy Loaders](https://github.com/klashdevelopment/Mika-Roblox/tree/main/loaders/doors/Saved%20Copies) and pick the latest one.
Then, add this into your scripting software and load it up!<br>

| Pros      | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Prevents deadlinks      | You will have to manually update it every time it updates.       |
| Code will not be modified   | If the game releases an anticheat for this version, you may be at risk of getting banned.        |

<summary>Use the latest versions of the script bundle</summary>

Simply head over to the [one main Loader](https://github.com/klashdevelopment/Mika-Roblox/tree/main/loaders/doors/Loader.lua).
Then, add this into your scripting software and load it up!
  
  
| Pros      | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Always recive the latest version.      | If the link changes, you will get a deadlink.       |
